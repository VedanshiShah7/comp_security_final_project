            <h2>About This Simulation</h2>
            <p>
                This interactive webpage simulates the <strong>BB84 quantum key distribution protocol</strong>, 
                a fundamental method for secure communication. The protocol enables two parties, Alice and Bob, 
                to establish a <strong>shared secret key</strong> over a quantum channel while detecting any 
                potential eavesdropping attempts by a third party (Eve). If Eve tries to intercept and measure 
                quantum states, errors are introduced, revealing her presence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use the controls below to set the number of qubits and toggle eavesdropping to see how it affects 
                key security. Various visualizations will help you understand the process and results.

            <div id="animationContainer"></div>
            <p>
                ‚öõÔ∏è <strong>What it shows:</strong> This section provides a visual representation of the quantum 
                states used in the BB84 protocol. Each qubit is transmitted using a random basis (rectilinear or diagonal), 
                and measurements are performed accordingly. If an eavesdropper intercepts the qubits, disturbances may appear 
                in the visualization, helping Alice and Bob detect interference.

            <h2>Key Distribution Analysis</h2>
            <canvas id="keyComparisonChart"></canvas>
            <p>
                üìä <strong>What it shows:</strong> This chart compares the bits of the 
                <strong>secret key</strong> generated by Alice and the key received by Bob. 
                Only qubits measured in the <strong>same basis</strong> contribute to the final key. 
                A high match rate means successful key distribution.

        <section id="eavesdropping">
            <h2>Eavesdropping Impact</h2>
            <canvas id="eavesdropChart"></canvas>
            <p>
                üìà <strong>What it shows:</strong> This line chart tracks the bits that Eve 
                (the eavesdropper) attempts to intercept. More interception increases the 
                chance of detection due to measurement-induced errors.

        <section id="additionalVisuals">
            <h2>Key Matching Histogram</h2>
            <canvas id="keyHistogram"></canvas>
            <p>
                üìä <strong>What it shows:</strong> This histogram represents the percentage 
                of <strong>key bits that successfully matched</strong> between Alice and Bob. 
                If eavesdropping is active, the match percentage is likely lower.
            </p>

            <h2>Eavesdropping Success Rate</h2>
            <canvas id="eavesdropPieChart"></canvas>
            <p>
                ü•ß <strong>What it shows:</strong> This pie chart displays the proportion of 
                bits intercepted by Eve versus those that remained unchanged. If a large portion 
                was intercepted, Alice and Bob may need to discard the key and restart.
